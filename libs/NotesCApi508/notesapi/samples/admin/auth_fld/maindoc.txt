How does Notes handle document Author fields?
When designing a form, the old data type "Doc Author" is gone. Instead,
there are now three new data types that seem to be related: Names,
Author Names, and Reader Names. How are each of these new data
types intended to be used?  And what's this $UpdateBy field I see
in documents when viewing "Fields" in the Document Properties InfoBox?
