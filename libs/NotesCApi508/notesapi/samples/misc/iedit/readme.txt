PROGRAM
-------
iedit - Example edit level import library


PURPOSE
-------
Demonstrates building a DLL which Notes can use to import data in a
non-Notes format.


ENVIRONMENTS
------------
Windows NT (32-bit) (not including DEC Alpha)
Windows 95/98 (32-bit)


FILES
-----
iedit.c      - Main C program source file.
ieditwin.c   - Windows (32-bit) -specific wrapper functions.
iedit.h      - Symbolic constants and function prototypes.
iedit.txt    - This is a short ASCII text file you may import
               into a document using iedit from the Notes UI.

mswin32.def  - Module definition file for Windows (32-bit).
mswin32.mak  - Make file for Windows 32-bit.

readme.txt   - This file. Specifies what is needed to use this example.


INSTALLING AND RUNNING iedit
----------------------------
To install iedit, copy the executable program library to the Notes program 
directory. The actual name of the DLL depends on the platform:

    32-bit Windows:         niedit.dll
    Solaris 1.1 Unix:       libiedit.so

Then edit the notes.ini file and add a new line of the form:

EDITIMPxx=<File Format Name>,0,<Library Name>,<w4w arg>,[<extension>,...]

where xx is a number that starts at 1 and is incremented for each
successive edit level import library.  Make sure to change the "xx" 
in "EDITIMPxx" to be one more than that of the last EDITIMP reference.

For example, the line

EDITIMP34=Sample ASCII Import,0,_IEDIT,,.TXT,.PRN,.C,.H,.RC,.DEF,

adds iedit to the list of file import libraries available. The 
string "Sample ASCII Import" will appear in the List of File 
Types in the File Import Dialog box.

In order for changes to the notes.ini file to take effect, you 
must exit and re-start Notes if it is running.

To test iedit, start the Notes workstation. From Notes, open a document 
for editing, move the cursor to a rich text field, and issue the File 
Import command from the Notes menu. The File Import dialog box appears.
In the File Name list box, select the names of one or more ASCII text 
files. In the List of File Types, select "Sample ASCII Import". Click
the Import button. Notes transfers control to the iedit progam library.
Iedit converts the selected ASCII text files to Rich Text format. Notes
inserts the rich text data into the document at the cursor position.
