INSTALLING AND RUNNING xview
----------------------------
To install xview, copy the executable program library to the Notes program 
directory. The actual name of the DLL is:

        32-bit Windows:         nxview.dll
        
Then edit the notes.ini file and add the following:


        VIEWEXPxx=Example View Export,1,_XVIEW,,.TXT,

where xx is a number that starts at 1 and is incremented for each
successive view level export library.  Make sure to change the "xx" 
in "VIEWEXPxx" to be one more than that of the last VIEWEXP reference.

For example, if your notes.ini file already contains a variable named 
VIEWEXP5, then use VIEWEXP6 or VIEWEXP7, etc, as necessary to get a unique 
variable name.
   
Restart Notes.  XVIEW is executed from the Notes user interface.

You may test XVIEW against any Domino database, but you must 
know the item names of two TYPE_TEXT items in the documents
that appear in the view.  In order for XVIEW to find items to 
export, you must specify these item names correctly in the  
fields of the dialog box titled "XVIEW Sample Export". 
You may discover the item names and types of notes in a database 
via the menu commands File - Document Properties.

From the Notes user interface, open a database of your choice. 
In the view, select one or more documents by clicking in the left 
column.  This puts a check mark in the column (any documents that 
contain an item of TYPE_TEXT may be exported).  Select File - Export.
"Example View Export" will appear as one of the File Types in the
"Save File as Type" scroll box. Specify a filename to export to.
Press "Export".  Notes calls XVIEW automatically. 

XVIEW displays a dialog box prompting for some static text 
and the names of two TYPE_TEXT items in the documents.  The static
text may be a line of dashes or asterisks that provide a visual
separation between text.  The item names must be valid item names 
available in the documents you are exporting.  Then click "OK".
XVIEW creates an ASCII output file that contains, for each note 
selected in the view, the static text followed by the TYPE_TEXT
items specified.
