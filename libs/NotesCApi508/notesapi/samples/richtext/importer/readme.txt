PROGRAM
-------
importer  - Shows how to load and call a Domino or Notes import library 


ENVIRONMENTS
------------
Windows NT (32-bit) (including DEC Alpha)
Windows 95/98 (32-bit)


FILES
-----
readme.txt   - This file. Specifies what is needed to use this example.
importer.c   - Main program.
graph.cgm    - A sample CGM Image that the user may import as a test.
mswin32.mak  - Makefile for Windows 32-bit.



PURPOSE
-------
This program demonstrates how to import several different kinds of
files into a rich text field of a Domino document.  The program has 
been tested with the following file format:

      CGM Image

Also included is an explanation on how to import a WordPro document.
    
File imports are accomplished through the use of import DLLs that are
specific to each format. The information about the DLLs used to import 
files is contained in the NOTES.INI file.  Following are two sample 
entries from NOTES.INI, and an explanation of the fields in each:

   EDITIMP5=CGM Image,0,_IFL,,.GMF,.CGM,,8,

The fields in this entry are:

    EDITIMP5         - Specifies that this is an EDIT-level import
                       entry.

    CGM Image        - This entry refers to CGM Image file. This 
                       is the string that appears in the list box in the
                       Notes file import dialog.

    0                - For Imports, this parameter is always zero.

    _IFL             - The DLL to be used to import this file.

    <blank>          - This field is left blank for graphics file import.

    .GMF, .CGM       - The default file extension for files of this
                       type. (This field is not important for this
                       example)


EDITIMP21=WordPro 96/97,0,_IW4W,W4W12F/V0,.LWP,,2,

The fields in this entry are:

    EDITIMP21        - Specifies that this is an EDIT-level import
                       entry.

    WordPro 96/97    - This entry refers to WordPro 96/97 documents.
                       This is the string that appears in the list box in 
                       the Notes file import dialog.

    0                - For Imports, this parameter is always zero.

    _IW4W            - The DLL to be used to import this file.

    W4W12F/V0        - This is the name of an additional DLL used by _IW4W
                       to import this word processing file.  This 
                       parameter is set to blank for non-word processing 
                       files.

    .LWP             - The default file extension for files of this
                       type. (This field is not important for this
                       example)


NOTE:
    The Windows 32-bit and DEC Alpha NT versions
    of Domino and Notes use slightly different naming conventions
    for their import DLLs.  The first character of a Windows
    NT or Windows 95/98 DLL filename is ('n'), and the first character of a
    DEC Alpha NT DLL filename is ('a').
    
    Since NOTES.INI is the same for Windows 32-bit and 
    DEC Alpha NT, the entries in NOTES.INI always use _
    for the first character.


RUNNING importer:
-----------------
The IMPORTER program takes four parameters:

   1) The filename of the database to which the document is to be 
      added.  This file should reside in the Domino or Notes data 
      directory.

   2) The fully qualified path name of the import DLL appropriate 
      to the format of the file being imported.  This information is
      found in the NOTES.INI file.  If the Domino or Notes directory is on
      your search path, then you can specify just the file name.

   3) The filename of the file to be imported.  If the file is not in 
      the current directory, the full path to the file must be supplied.

   4) If importing a word processing file, the name of the additional DLL
      specified in the NOTES.INI entry. If not importing a word
      processing file, this parameter is omitted.


A sample command line to invoke this program might look like
the following under Windows 95/98.  Filenames and paths would need to be changed 
to suit the user's specific environment.
