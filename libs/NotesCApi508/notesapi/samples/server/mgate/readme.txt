INSTALLING mgate
----------------
These instructions assume that you are working on a test Lotus Domino Server. 
Do not test MGATE on a production server.

1) Create directories named

		\MGATE

		\MGATE\PROGRAM

		\MGATE\INBOUND

		\MGATE\USER

		\MGATE\USER\BOB

2) Put all the files in this directory into \MGATE\PROGRAM.

3) Go to the directory \MGATE\PROGRAM.

4) Copy IMGATE.EXE into the Domino program directory.

5) Go to your Domino data directory.

6) Edit NOTES.INI.

	Add the following lines

		MgateDrive=C:   (or other drive that contains \MGATE)

		MgateDomain=MGATE_DOMAIN

		MgateInterval=2

		MailTimeout=1

	Find the line that begins with "ServerTasks" and add ",MGATE" to the 
	end of this line.

7) With the Notes workstation software, add a domain record 
to the server's Domino Directory (Address book). Set the fields as follows:

		Domain type:  Foreign Domain
		Foreign domain name: MGATE_DOMAIN

		Gateway server name: <your server name>
			Note:  If <your server name> is a hierarchical
			       name, specify the full server name in
			       abbreviated format, for example,
			       myserver/Acme

		Gateway mail file name: MGATE.NSF

8) Start (or restart) the Lotus Domino Server software.



SENDING AN OUTBOUND MESSAGE
---------------------------
How It Works

An outbound message is one that originates from a Notes user and is 
destined for someone outside the Domino and Notes mail system.

Outbound messages first are routed through the foreign domain that you 
created above. The gateway mail file holds the messages until MGATE is 
ready to transfer them to the foreign users. Based on the modification 
time of the gateway mail file, MGATE detects when there are pending 
outbound messages.

When MGATE finds an outbound message, it delivers the message to a 
directory with the same name as the foreign user. (For this reason, all 
foreign user names must be 8 characters or less.) All foreign user 
directories are contained within \MGATE\USER.

After delivery, the outbound message is a plain ASCII text file. Each line 
of the file begins with an item code, which is one of:

	A - Attachment  (path name of attachment file, original file name)
	B - Body text line
	C - CC name
	D - Time/date
	O - Originator name
	S - Subject
	T - To name

Following the item code on each line is the contents of the item. 

For example, a message from a Notes user delivered to a foreign mail user 
might appear as follows in \MGATE\USER\BOB.

	D08-02-91 03:31:18 PM
	TBob @ MGATE_DOMAIN
	OChuck @ NOTES
	SHello...
	BHow are you !!!
	BI hope you are having a good day.

If a directory for the foreign user is not found, MGATE continues to look 
for the directory during every outbound attempt, until the mail times out. 
The time-out interval (in hours) is specified by MailTimeout. When an 
outbound message times out, a failure report is sent to the mail's sender.



TESTING AN OUTBOUND MESSAGE
---------------------------
To test the outbound portion of MGATE

1) Start (or switch to) the Notes workstation software.

2) Make sure your mail server is set to the test server you are 
working on.

3) Send a Domino mail message to Bob @ MGATE_DOMAIN.

4) Very quickly, the message should be delivered to \MGATE\USER\BOB. 
The name of the message file should be 0.MSG.



RECEIVING AN INBOUND MESSAGE
----------------------------
How It Works

An inbound message is one that originates outside of Domino and Notes and 
is destined for a Notes user.

MGATE looks for inbound messages in the \MGATE\INBOUND directory. This 
directory is scanned periodically, based on the number of minutes 
specified by MgateInterval. When an inbound message is found, MGATE 
transforms it into a Domino mail message and passes it to the local Domino 
mail router. 

If Domino cannot deliver the message, MGATE returns it to the 
sender's directory under \MGATE\USER.

Message files may have any name, as long as they have the extension .MSG. 
Attachments files may have any name, as long as they have the extension 
.ATT.

Within an inbound message file, the first character of each line is an 
item code, which is one of:

	A - Attachment  (path name of attachment file, original file name)
	B - Body text line
	C - CC name
	D - Time/date
	O - Originator name
	R - Recipient (full email address)
	S - Subject
	T - To name

Following the item code on each line is the contents of the item. Items 
can be repeated as many times as necessary and in any order.



TESTING AN INBOUND MESSAGE
--------------------------
To test the inbound portion of MGATE

1) Create a file named 0.MSG with the following contents

	D08-03-91 04:31:18 PM
		T<short name for user>
                R<full name of user in local Address book>
		OBob
		SHello to you too...
		BI am fine.
		BI hope you are well also.

2) Make sure the mail server for the recipient is the local test server. 
(This ensures that the router will be able to deliver the mail.)

3) Copy the file to \MGATE\INBOUND. 

4) Within the next 2 minutes, the message should be sent to the 
designated Notes user.
