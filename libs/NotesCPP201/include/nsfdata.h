/*	This is the structure that identifies ALL replicas of the same note.  The
	"File" member contains a totally unique (random) number, generated at
	the time the note is created.  The "Note" member contains the date/time
	when the very first copy of the note was stored into the first NSF.  The
	"Sequence" member is a sequence number used to keep track of the most
	recent version of the note for replicated data purposes.  The
	"SequenceTime" member is a sequence number qualifier, that allows the
	replicator to determine which note is later given identical Sequence's. 
	Both are required for the following reason.  The sequence number is needed
	to prevent someone from locking out future edits by setting the time/date
	to the future.  The sequence time qualifies the sequence number for two
	reasons:  1)  It prevents two concurrent updates from looking like
	no update at all and 2) it forces all systems to reach the same decision
	as to which update is the "latest" version.

	Time/dates associated with notes:

		OID.Note				Timedate when the note was created
								Obtained by NSFNoteGetInfo(_NOTE_OID) or
								OID in SEARCH_MATCH.
		OID.SequenceTime		Timedate of last revision
								Obtained by NSFNoteGetInfo(_NOTE_OID) or
								OID in SEARCH_MATCH.
		NOTE.EditModified		Timedate when added to (or last updated in) 
								this database.
								(Obtained by NSFNoteGetInfo(_NOTE_MODIFIED) or
