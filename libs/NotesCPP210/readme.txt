To install a toolkit, create a toolkit directory on your hard drive 
(for example, \notescpp) and copy the contents of the toolkit 
subdirectory on this CD to the directory you created. For example, to
install the C++ API 2.1 PC Toolkit to d:\notescpp, copy everything in
the PC directory, including all subdirectories, to d:\notescpp. If you
need to install toolkits for more than one platform, do not install 
them in the same directory.

Some of the toolkits are in compressed form. If files you copied to your
toolkit directory are compressed, decompress them after copying them 
using the appropriate utility or command.

For additional installation instructions, refer to the readme file in 
the toolkit directory after you copy and decompress the toolkit files.
